# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

Whenever you need to check if a certain condition is met. I like to think of it as a fork in the road. Depending on circumstances, you may go one way or another. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

In terms of time, I would sit down and practice it a lot more. I am working a fulltime job still (until july 1st), so I am unfortunately doing the bare minimum to knock out everything.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

I like solving the challenging problem. The fizzbuzz example was fun, gave me a good fix of dopamine after seeing it work as intended.
